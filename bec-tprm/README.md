# GitHub Repo Add-on: BEC Playbook — Supply Chain Compromise (TPRM)

This add-on includes:
- **/playbooks/BEC_SupplyChain_TPRM_Playbook.md** — the primary playbook
- **/playbooks/templates/BEC_TPRM_Templates.md** — scripts and checklists
- **/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bec-supply-chain-tprm.yml** — an incident issue template for GitHub

## Suggested usage
1. Copy these files into your security runbooks repository.
2. Protect the playbook directory with **CODEOWNERS** (recommended).
3. Enable GitHub Issues and the included issue template to standardize incident intake.

## Optional: CODEOWNERS snippet
Add something like:
- `/playbooks/ @security-ir-team @procurement-lead @finance-ap-lead`
